# Voice Capture Console Logging Guide

## 🎤 **Comprehensive Voice Capture Logging**

I've added detailed console logging throughout the voice capture system. Here's what you'll see when you speak:

## 📊 **Complete Log Flow**

### **1. Voice Recognition Start**
```
🎤 Attempting to start voice recognition...
🔧 Pre-start checks: {isSupported: true, isListening: false, ...}
🚀 Starting speech recognition...
✅ Speech recognition start() called successfully
🎤 Voice recognition started
🔧 Recognition settings: {continuous: true, interimResults: true, ...}
```

### **2. Voice Detection**
```
🎤 Voice recognition result received: {resultIndex: 0, resultsLength: 1, ...}
📝 Result 0: {transcript: "hello", confidence: 0.95, isFinal: false}
🔄 Interim transcript: hello
```

### **3. Final Transcript**
```
📝 Result 0: {transcript: "hello world", confidence: 0.98, isFinal: true}
✅ Final transcript ready: hello world
📊 Transcript stats: {length: 11, wordCount: 2, ...}
```

### **4. AI Processing**
```
🎯 Starting transcript processing...
📝 Transcript: hello world
📊 Processing details: {transcriptLength: 11, wordCount: 2, aiTutorAvailable: true, ...}
🤖 Calling AI Tutor service...
📡 Request details: {userMessage: "hello world", hasImage: false, ...}
```

### **5. AI Response**
```
✅ AI Response received successfully!
📝 Response details: {responseLength: 150, wordCount: 25, ...}
💬 Response text: Hello! I'm your AI tutor for Mars exploration...
```

### **6. Text-to-Speech**
```
🔊 Using ElevenLabs for TTS...
🎵 TTS details: {text: "Hello! I'm your AI tutor...", voiceId: "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM", ...}
✅ ElevenLabs TTS completed
```

## 🔍 **Debug Information**

### **Service Availability**
```
🔧 Available services: {elevenLabs: true, gemini: true, tutor: true}
```

### **Error Details**
```
❌ Error processing transcript: Error message
🔍 Error details: {message: "...", stack: "...", timestamp: "..."}
```

### **Fallback TTS**
```
🔊 Starting fallback TTS...
📝 Fallback text: I heard you say: hello world
🔧 Fallback details: {textLength: 25, audioManagerAvailable: true, ...}
✅ Using AudioManager.playTTS for fallback
✅ Fallback TTS started successfully
```

## 🎯 **What to Look For**

### **✅ Working Correctly**
- All steps show timestamps
- No error messages
- AI response received
- TTS plays successfully

### **❌ Common Issues**
- **No AI Response**: Check if Gemini API key is configured
- **No TTS**: Check if ElevenLabs API key is configured
- **Recognition Errors**: Check microphone permissions
- **Service Not Available**: Check API key configuration

## 🚀 **Testing Steps**

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
2. **Start Voice Capture** (should see start logs)
3. **Speak Clearly** (should see detection logs)
4. **Check Response** (should see AI processing logs)
5. **Listen for Audio** (should see TTS logs)

## 📱 **Console Filtering**

To focus on specific parts, use console filters:
- **Voice Detection**: Filter by "🎤" or "📝"
- **AI Processing**: Filter by "🤖" or "✅"
- **TTS**: Filter by "🔊" or "🎵"
- **Errors**: Filter by "❌" or "⚠️"

The logging will show you exactly where the process succeeds or fails!
